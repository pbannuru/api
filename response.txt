It helps us go beyond our personal limits and prevents us from getting tripped up in life’s overwhelming complexity.

Just a few minutes of cleaning\nallows for so much clarity and wisdom to dawn.\n\nr\n\n“I think that the cleaning method is possibly the most important of all the Heartfulness practices,” said Daaji. “Chariji used to\nsay that meditating without cleaning is like having a fancy car\nthat’s stuck in the mud. A supercar won’t do you much good\nwithout a decent road! Similarly, no matter how much you meditate, you won’t get very far without cleaning, because the beautiful inner state that you create will remain covered by so many\nlayers of impurity.\n“Nevertheless, we should never think ourselves to be impure\nor unclean. With the cleaning method, we move toward purity\nwithout ever thinking ourselves to be impure. We move toward\nsimplicity without ever thinking ourselves to be complex. Beneath\nour samskaras, we are already pure and simple! Impurity never\ntouches the soul, you see. It only obscures it and prevents its\ndivine rays from illuminating our consciousness. When that is\nthe case, our awareness diminishes. We become less cognizant.\n\n\n-----\n\n'}

Yama refers to the removal of\nunwanted tendencies. This is exactly what we achieve with the\ncleaning method. Through meditation, we create an inner environment where unwanted seeds cannot take root, but it is\nthrough the cleaning method that we fry up the existing seeds\nand pull out the complex root structures already embedded so\ndeeply within.\n“In yogic philosophy, thought-\xadseeds that have already been\nplanted in the subconscious are known as _samskaras, or_\nimpressions.”\n“Does every thought end up taking root in the subconscious\nand becoming an impression?” I asked.\n“It is the thought’s emotional content that gets planted—\xadnot\nthe thought itself,” said Daaji. “A samskara is your emotional\nmemory. It is the emotion associated with that particular thought.\nWe may not retain that memory at a conscious level—\xadwe may\nnot retain the existential memory—\xadbut its emotional content certainly remains with us. Most of the time, that emotional content\nremains dormant. It’s hidden away in the subconscious.

This produces\nsimilar thoughts to the parent thought—\xadthe thought with which\nthe emotion was originally associated. When thoughts and emotions become repetitive, our reactions become habitual.”\n“So our emotions create the samskaras that are planted in\nthe subconscious,” I said.\n“Yes,” said Daaji, “but every thought has some emotional\ncontent.

To bathe or brush\nyour teeth is a matter of outer hygiene. The cleaning is all about\ninner hygiene. It makes your consciousness crystal clear.”\n“When you say impurities, you mean samskaras, right?” I\nasked.\n“Yes,” said Daaji. “But this is all within the realm of theory\nand philosophy. When you actually do the cleaning, you feel so\nlight afterward. You feel so fresh. It is a tangible feeling. That\nfeeling motivates you, regardless of whether you are convinced by\nthe theory of samskaras or not. I think that the feeling of lightness is the reason that most people use this method. They feel a\ndifference in themselves, which they appreciate.\n“Over time, we also find changes in ourselves. Many habits\nand tendencies simply drop off. Sometimes, you don’t even notice\nthat they are gone. Then somebody says, ‘What happened to you,\nman? You used to be so irritated all the time.’ ‘Oh, really?’ you\nsay.

Furthermore, cleaning removes impressions before they can manifest as experiences. To remove them\nwithout having to undergo them is like having an operation\nunder anesthesia.

In fact, the foundation of our samskaric edifice is completely removed in our very first sitting with a\ntrainer. No edifice can stand without an intact foundation. It is\nbound to collapse, sooner or later.\n“In this process of purification, our role is to perform our own\nindividual cleaning at the end of each day. By doing so, we remove\nthat particular day’s worth of samskaric accumulation. By continuing to take regular sittings with a trainer, we can exhaust our\nsamskaric load within a portion of our life.\n“Yet, despite the fact that we clean our samskaras day by day\nand take sittings a few times per month, the load won’t get any\nlighter unless we also stop creating new impressions.

Finally,\nwe enter samadhi, when we start to dissolve into the Source.\n“Patanjali’s third step is asana, which means ‘posture.’ In\norder to choose the best asana, we should consider which pose\nwill best lead to pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. The\nfirst thing we do in meditation is to turn ourselves inward. That’s\npratyahara. Our physicality can help us here. If our eyes are wide\nopen, if our bodies are sprawled out, and if our legs are stretched\nin front of us, it’s not going to help us go within. Such poses lend\nthemselves to a more external orientation. To achieve pratyahara, our physicality has to adopt a contracted form.\n“This is, of course, a matter for personal experience. So try\nboth ways. Meditate with your arms and legs stretched out.\nMeditate with them folded. Then see the difference for yourself.”\n“I’ve already experimented with this,” I said.\n“What did you find?” he asked.\n“It’s just as you said. It was harder for me to really go inside\nwhen my limbs were stretched out.”\n“That’s why the traditional posture for meditation is a seated\npose with folded legs,” said Daaji. “The position of the hands is\nalso important.

Or, you can rest one hand on top of the other.\nAnd we meditate with closed eyes.”\n“In some methods, people meditate with open eyes,” I said.\n“The ancient literature describes the senses as the gates\nthrough which awareness flows,” said Daaji. “Sight is the most\nprominent sense. We tend to focus upon whatever we see, so\nclosing that gate of sight helps us reorient our awareness inward,\nwhich is pratyahara. From asana and pratyahara, we then proceed\nthrough the rest of the steps: dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.\n\n\n-----\n\n'}

Then you\ncan continue your meditation.\n“A time also comes when we do enter into a thoughtless state.\nThis happens when we go further into the subtler realms of consciousness. The great Swami Vivekananda once said, ‘Con\xadscious\xad\n\nness is a mere film between two oceans, the subconscious and\nthe superconscious’ (Vivekananda 2009). Let’s look at these two\nwords: sub and super. By pairing the prefix ‘sub’ with the word\n‘conscious,’ we see that the subconscious is beneath our conscious awareness. Conversely, the superconscious is above our\nconscious awareness. So the sub-\xad and superconscious are both\nbeyond our conscious awareness. Yet, one is a lower unconsciousness, while the other is higher.\n“The subconscious is vast, as is the superconscious. In fact,\nboth are infinite. Through yogic practice, our conscious awareness expands through both of them. When we sleep at night, we\ndive deep into oceans of the subconscious. Actually, this occurs\nthrough a special state of yogic sleep called _yoganidra. We’ll_\ndiscuss this later when we take up the subject of prayer. It is also\nnecessary to purify the subconscious. The subconscious is filled\nwith the remnants of past experiences. It’s also the home of our\nlower instincts and drives. We’ll also go into this subject more\ndeeply when we discuss the cleaning method.\n“Now, let’s discuss the superconscious. It is the godly realm,\nand in meditation, we soar into its endless skies. It is from there\nthat wisdom descends. It is from there that inspiration strikes\nyour heart. In the superconscious, we are suffused with energy\nfrom the Source.\n\n\n-----\n\n'}

In this sense, a heart that is open is a heart that is humble.”\n“I don’t follow,” I said.\n“Any egotist can give, but it takes a humble person to receive,”\nDaaji said.\nPulling a coin from his pocket, he handed it to me. As he did\nso, he asked, “Do you see the position of your hand?” It was open,\npalm facing upward.\n“We associate this pose with asking,” he said. “Prayer is to\nask for higher help. Whether you ask for yourself or for others,\nasking always requires humility, which is what allows us to pray\nin the first place.\n“Conversely, if I were to think of myself as the Giver, as the\nInfinite Source, then nobody in the world could help me. Even\nGod could not help me. I must have the humility to realize that\nno matter what I may give to others, none of it has originated\nwith me.

Rather,\nthe relationship is cyclic.\n“One way to understand the interaction between the subconscious mind and our conscious thoughts is by comparing it to\na garden. A conscious thought is like a seed, sown into the fertile\nground of the subconscious. That seed then germinates in the\nsubconscious. Eventually, it blossoms into our conscious awareness and becomes an enduring pattern of similar thoughts. Just\nas a single seed produces a tree from which thousands of new\nseeds are grown, a single thought can grow into a tendency of\nthinking, through which we produce thousands of new thought-\xad\nseeds. You can see how our consciousness can easily turn into a\ncomplex jungle!\n“The cleaning method hits at the very root. It is not about\nunderstanding or consciously reprogramming our habits of thinking and behavior. Instead, it works directly upon the subconscious. It is like weeding a garden. Whenever we pull up weeds,\nwe must be sure to pull them out by their roots. If their roots\nremain in the ground, the weeds will continue to sprout, over\nand over again. Similarly, whatever we have already planted in\nthe subconscious will continue to sprout in the form of thoughts\nand emotions. Unless we deal with those roots, our attempts at\ntransformation often lead to frustration.”\n\n\n-----\n\n'}

For example, it is common to pray\nbefore eating, but if after that prayer is completed, you attack\nyour food like a wolf, what happens to the prayerful mood that\nyou have just created? Without a prayerful inner state, prayer is\nonly an artifice. It is absurd.\n“Often, we teach children to write by giving them stencils of\nthe letters of the alphabet. By tracing the letters, they learn how\nto write on their own. Similarly, formal prayer must evolve into\nprayerfulness. Thereafter, formal prayer becomes unnecessary\nand redundant. If we do not graduate into prayerfulness, we are\nlike adults who still rely upon stencils to write the alphabet.\n“This inner state is unique. It has no external face or any\nexternal principles to be followed, meaning rituals. The moment\nyou make prayer a ritual, it loses its importance.\n“However, prayerfulness is just another beginning. Its purpose\nis to take us beyond, to take us to yet another level.”\n“What lies beyond prayerfulness?” I asked him.\n“Oneness,” said Daaji. “Duality is intrinsic to prayer. In\nprayer, there are always two: a person in need and the personality\nwhose help is needed. I offer prayer, and the Great Being is supposed to listen to me and answer my prayers. Without this duality,\nwho would offer prayer, and who would receive it? The distinction between the divine presence and me still remains. There are\nstill two. There is still a relationship. Through meditation, on the\nother hand, we progressively enter into a state of oneness with\nthe divine presence within. We transcend relationship.\n\n\n-----\n\n'}

But pranayama has a deeper\nmeaning. The word is composed of two roots: prana and aayaama.\nWe already discussed the traditional meaning of prana, which is\nlife force. Aayaama means ‘expanding.’”\n“So ‘pranayama’ means ‘expanding life force,’” I said.\n“Right,” said Daaji. “It has nothing to do with breathing, per\nse. Whenever we receive transmission, we are receiving the very\nhighest force into our hearts.

Previously, mother and baby were one.\nWhen the mother ate, the baby ate. Their existences were intertwined. After the baby’s birth, they became two distinct entities.\nOne became two.\n“Similarly, the creation of the soul is the moment that it\nbecomes separate from its Source. For the first time, unity is lost.\nFor the first time, we experience incompleteness. We experience\ndissatisfaction. Certain theologies call this ‘the fall.’ With meditation, we reenter that state of unity and stillness. We regain our\noriginality, our universality.\n“Many people believe that we can only return to the Source\nafter death. Then, there is the voice of logic, which tells us that\nthe only way we could return to the Source would be to go back\nin time! Neither is true. Through meditation, we achieve that\ngrand union here and now, while still alive. To master yoga is to\ntranscend the limitations of death and the limitations of time.
